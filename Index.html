  <p align=center>During the third generation, technology envisaged a shift from huge transistors to integrated circuits, also referred to as IC. Here a variety of transistors were placed on silicon chips, called semiconductors. The most feature of this eraâ€™s computer was the speed and reliability. IC was made from silicon and also called silicon chips. </p>
